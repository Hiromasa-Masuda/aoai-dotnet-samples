# Azure OpenAI Service .NET samples
## Chat Completions Streaming Sample
[Chat Completions Streaming Sample](https://github.com/Hiromasa-Masuda/aoai-dotnet-samples/tree/main/src/ChatCompletionsStreaming) is a sample code that uses the Azure OpenAI Service client library for .NET to retrieve responses as stream data. “ChatStreamingConsoleApp001” is a front-end sample, and “ChatStreamingWebApp001” is a back-end sample. “ChatStreamingConsoleApp001” supports two scenarios: one where requests are made directly from the front-end to AOAI, and another where requests are made to AOAI via the back-end. If you want to run the scenario via the back-end, please start “ChatStreamingWebApp001” first.
